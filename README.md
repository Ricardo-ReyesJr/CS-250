How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
_By understanding what the user needs and trying your best to see it from their point of view we are able to produce a user-friendly product and experience. User stories help us guide us there._

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
_I approach it from a solution point of view not from a problem point of view. What is the solution we need to have a happy user? I will incorporate the Scrum agile methodology.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
_Being willing to work together means being willing to let go of some of your ideas and allow others to have their input._
